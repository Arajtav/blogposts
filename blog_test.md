# New album / Blog test

## Blog test

I just rewrote backend of my blog, and I need to write something to see if it works.\
I don't want to have random empty posts or something like that, so I'm gonna write about an album I'm going to release soon (maybe).

## Album

Album will have 3 tracks (it's an EP actually), and will be titled "Ar√§jtav" (probably).\
All of those tracks I made over half a year ago, but one was unfinished.\
Recently I forced myself to finish making it.\
Now I only need to force myself to make cover art and I will release it.

## Demos

I just realized, it was over 7 months ago. Anyway, demos: [first track](https://soundcloud.com/arajtav/sometimes-demo) and [last track](https://soundcloud.com/arajtav/v-demo).
