# Hi!

## Intro?

Hi. Welcome to my blog.\
This will be a very short post, because I'm bad at writing stuff.\
I'm Ar√§jtav, but you probably knew that already, otherwise you wouldn't be on my webpage.\
My name is a made up word, I have no idea how it should be pronounced.\
Anyway, since this is my fist blog post ever, I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing.

## What I do

Usually I'm just wasting time, but sometimes I make music or code.\
In fact, I coded (and designed) this webpage.\
From music, I still haven't released any albums, but I have a lot of random stuff on 
[soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/arajtav).

## What I like

A lot of things actually, cats, programming, playing Minecraft, dogs, all kinds of languages, monospace fonts, foxes,
music (I'll probably write a separate post about what kinds music, you can check my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Arajtav) if you want to know now),
other animals, making stuff, looking at glitched images or listening to glitched audio, reading books, optimizing stuff.\
There probably is more.

## What I hate
I'd rather not say.

## What?
I have no idea.

## Outro?
I said this will be a short post.\
If you want to contact me, dm me on discord (arajtav#0000) or email me (<arajtav@arajtav.com> 
should work, if not <arajtav@gmail.com>)\
Oh, also I'm a furry (which I feel I shouldn't mention), and I'm from Poland.

## Info
This post was originally posted on 16.08.2024, However I needed to change some stuff.
